# Quiet

Turns off all desktop notifications when you're in a scheduled meeting. For MacOS. Made by [Ellen Li](https://github.com/ellenli) using Swift, Objective-C, and Ruby. **In progress.**

This is my first app. Here are some reads and tools that helped me put this together.

- [Write a Mac App in Swift](http://footle.org/WeatherBar/)
- [Google APIs Client Library for Objective-C For REST](https://github.com/google/google-api-objectivec-client-for-rest/)
