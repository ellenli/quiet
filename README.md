Turns off all desktop notifications when you're in a scheduled meeting. For MacOS. Written in Swift, Objective-C, and Ruby. **In progress.**

- [Write a Mac App in Swift](http://footle.org/WeatherBar/)
- [Google APIs Client Library for Objective-C For REST](https://github.com/google/google-api-objectivec-client-for-rest/)
- [Accessing Google Services Using the OAuth 2.0 Protocol](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/accessing-google-services-using-the-oauth-20-protocol--mobile-18394)
